## Project Background
You are reviewing comprehensive documentation for an Interactive Data Analysis Platform designed to transform Excel/CSV data handling through a web-based solution. This platform addresses a specific organizational need where staff members work extensively with Excel files containing various data types.

## Original Project Vision
The platform aims to:
- Convert static Excel/CSV files into interactive, editable dashboards
- Enable secure collaborative analysis with multi-level permissions
- Provide data pairing capabilities to combine datasets using predefined logic
- Offer advanced analytics including statistical modules and machine learning
- Maintain full data editability with robust export functionality

## Core Concepts
- **Workspace ("Munkater√ºlet")**: Central organizational unit where users upload, manage, and analyze data
- **Temporal Data Management**: Each dataset is tagged with specific validity periods (FROM-TO dates)
- **Tagging System**: Datasets are categorized with tags for improved searchability
- **Multi-tiered Permissions**: Granular access controls for viewing and editing data
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed for future feature additions and integrations

## Technical Stack (For Context)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15+, TypeScript, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python, Pydantic
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with specialized data handling
- **Deployment**: Multi-cloud support with containerization
